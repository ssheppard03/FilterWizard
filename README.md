### Filter Wizard

Change obs filters using hand gestures. Each finger up or down on the right hand can correlate to a filter, allowing 32 potential filters. To download:

1. Get virtual cam [here](https://github.com/miaulightouch/obs-virtual-cam). Follow the install instructions.
2. Add a new virtual cam filter to your webcam and run it.
3. You can now connect and edit your scene filers by running open_webcam.py. Do not edit the webcam filters those will cause the hand tracking to mess up.
